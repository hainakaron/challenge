# Tasks

1. Implement the `add_entry_to_stats` function. The `entry` dictionary can contain groups (e.g. currency, country_code) that are not yet in the `stats`.
2. Implement the `merge_stats` function. It has to support nested objects of any depth.

The examples of data for both tasks can be found in the `tests.py` module alongside with the sample tests.
Make sure to take into account any potential edge cases and add tests for them.
